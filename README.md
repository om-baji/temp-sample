# Next.js Starter Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started (Beginner Friendly)

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Download and Extract the Project

- Click the green **"Code"** button on the GitHub repository page.
- Select **"Download ZIP"**.
- Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

### 2. Open the Project Folder

- Open the extracted folder.
- Inside, you will find a folder named `sample`. Open this folder in your terminal or command prompt.

### 3. Install Dependencies

You need to install the required packages before running the project. You can use **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**. If you are unsure, use **npm** (comes with Node.js).

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 16 or higher recommended).

In your terminal, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Or, if you prefer another package manager:

```bash
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

After installing dependencies, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with your chosen package manager:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### 5. View the App in Your Browser

Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should see the app running!

## Editing the Project

- You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx` inside the `sample` folder. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing packages, make sure you ran the install step inside the `sample` folder.
- If you have issues with Node.js, check that it is installed and up to date.
